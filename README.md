# raspi-mtp-autocopy
Scripts for Raspberry Pi to automate file copying from mobile devices

## Setup your Raspbian
Download an image from http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/

I used 2014-09-09-wheezy-raspbian.img

Write the image to an SD card. See http://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/linux.md

### First boot
* Take all the space in the SD card to use
* Set a password
* Set your keyboard layout
* Allow SSH connections

## Second boot
Setup your network.

After you have got your system to connect to a network at boot, you can login with SSH and there's no need for display nor keyboard anymore.

### Install packages

Install support for MTP:

```
sudo apt-get install mtp-tools mtpfs
```

Upgrade system packages to latest package versions (this might take 10 minutes)

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
```

### Set udev rules

First, find out the vendor and product IDs of the devices you want to connect to your RasPi and copy files automatically.

```
# E.g.
sudo mtp-detect

# This might reveal the IDs, too:
lsusb
```
I'm using Samsung Tab 3:

* IdVendor: 04e8
* IdProduct: 6860

When you have the IDs, add a udev rule. My command was:
```
sudo bash -c "echo 'SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="04e8", ATTR{idProduct}=="6860", MODE="0666"' > /etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules"

# Restart USB services
sudo service udev restart
```

### Configure fuse

Modify /etc/fuse.conf:

```
# This uncomments a line beginning with "user_allow_other"
sudo sed -i 's/^#user_allow_other/user_allow_other/' /etc/fuse.conf
```

### Add a mount point

```
sudo mkdir /media/SamsungTab3
sudo chmod a+rwx /media/SamsungTab3

# This should add user "pi" to "fuse" group:
sudo adduser $USER fuse
```

## Setup the Auto Copy

### Auto-mount of backup drives

Install usbmount so that usb drives will mount at /media/usb:
```
sudo apt-get install usbmount
```

### copier.sh

Download copier.sh to the RasPi:
```
cd
wget -nc https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kiistala/raspi-mtp-autocopy/master/copier.sh
```

### Auto-executing copier.sh

Now we need to trigger the copier.sh script every time a tablet is connected.

Download connect2backup.py script:
```
cd
wget -nc https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kiistala/raspi-mtp-autocopy/master/connect2backup.py
```

Add a line to /etc/rc.local:

```
/usr/bin/python /home/pi/connect2backup.py &
```

Restart and test:

1. Start the RasPi
2. Connect a USB drive. The CSV files will be copied from tablet to the USB drive.
3. Connect a Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 tablet
4. Wait until the light in the USB drive stops blinking â€“ copying has finished
5. Disconnect the tablet

# Safe shutdowns with unplug2shutdown

With this script you can shutdown RasPi safely. Unplugging a chosen USB device initiates shutdown sequence.

Install dependencies and download the script into home directory of user pi:
```
cd
sudo apt-get -y install python-gi python-gobject python-gudev
wget -nc https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kiistala/unplug2shutdown/master/src/unplug2shutdown.py
chmod -v u+x unplug2shutdown.py
```

Configure your shutdown device:
```
sudo ./unplug2shutdown.py --configure
```
Now, the script waits for you to insert a USB device:

```
Please connect the USB device you want to use as handler to shutdown your Raspberry Pi.
It could be anything: a Flash Disk, MMC Adapter, Wireless Adapter, etc.
```

And as it's inserted:

```
You chose this device:

    USB_Mass_Storage_Device
    USBest_Technology_USB_Mass_Storage_Device_000000000000D4

Press [Enter] to confirm this device, or pluginanother one or [CTRL + C] to exit
Got ya
Configuration have been saved.
RaspberryPi will shutdown by removing: USB_Mass_Storage_Device
Bye!
```

The unplug2shutdown script needs to be started on every boot, so let's add a line to /etc/rc.local:

```
/usr/bin/python /home/pi/unplug2shutdown.py &
```

Check the script permissions:
```
sudo chmod 755 /home/pi/unplug2shutdown.py
```

Test first without reboot:
```
sudo python /home/pi/unplug2shutdown.py &
# Insert and remove the USB device. See if the system halts.
```
If that worked, then reboot and test again, now without starting the script manually.
```
sudo reboot
```
